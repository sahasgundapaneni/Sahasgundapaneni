## My Projects!!

### ðŸ“Œ [Gator-Library-Management](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/Gator-Library-Management.git)
- Implemented a self-balancing Red-Black Tree for efficient book search, insertion, and deletion. Optimized tree operations to maintain O(log n) complexity.
- Designed a Binary Min-Heap to manage book reservations with priority handling. Ensured automatic book allocation upon return, handling edge cases effectively.
- Developed a command-driven system to process batch operations via input files. Implemented structured output logging for tracking execution results.
- Investigated and debugged color flip inconsistencies in Red-Black Tree operations. Ensured core functionalities remained unaffected, maintaining system efficiency.
- Deepened expertise in data structures (RBT & Min-Heap) for real-world applications. Strengthened debugging and file automation skills. Gained experience in handling large-scale command execution efficiently.

### ðŸ“Œ [Facial-Recognition-through-SVM](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/Facial-Recognition-through-SVM.git)
- Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Used Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classifier to match test images with trained faces.
- Processed and cleaned facial image datasets using scikit-learn. Applied eigenface representation to improve recognition accuracy.
- Trained the model on eigenfaces and fine-tuned SVM hyperparameters for optimal performance. Evaluated model accuracy using test images and improved prediction consistency.
- Structured the project into initialization, training, and recognition phases. Automated data handling and feature extraction using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Strengthened knowledge in machine learning (PCA, SVM) & computer vision. Gained experience in data preprocessing & optimization for facial recognition. Understood real-world applications of biometric authentication and AI-based security systems.

### ðŸ“Œ [UF-Course-Planner-Redesign_UXD-Project](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/UF-Course-Planner-Redesign_UXD-Project.git)
- Conducted user interviews and usability testing to understand student and advisor needs. Assisted in affinity diagramming to categorize feedback into themes like system limitations, user experience, and desired functionality.
- Designed low-fidelity wireframes for course planning, profile management, and conflict resolution. Developed interactive prototypes showcasing an intuitive drag-and-drop course planner to replace confusing dropdown-based selections.
- Led structured usability test sessions, analyzing user behavior and feedback. Identified key issues such as navigation complexity, unclear prerequisite handling, and course selection difficulties. Refined system alerts, improving error messaging, visual cues, and support options.
- Combined course selection and planning into a single interface for better user flow. Replaced dropdowns with a drag-and-drop interface for clarity. Based on professor feedback, shifted focus to prerequisite tracking rather than speculative scheduling conflicts.

### ðŸ“Œ [Actor-Modeling_DOSP-Project](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/Actor-Modeling_DOSP-Project.git)
- Implemented work unit distribution across multiple cores to improve parallel processing efficiency. Experimented with different work unit sizes to balance communication overhead vs. execution speed.
- Analyzed CPU time vs. real time to measure parallel efficiency. Optimized execution by adjusting number of workers and sequence processing limits.
- Addressed actor model synchronization issues for better parallel execution. Improved error handling and debugging strategies, focusing on actor safety and reference capabilities.
- Conducted large-scale tests with n = 100000000, k = 20, workers = 4, verifying system limits. Identified challenges like increased execution time with higher workload parameters.

### ðŸ“Œ [ImageClassification-MIT](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/ImageClassification.git)
- Automated Flowers17 dataset download & organization. Structured images into labeled folders for training.
- Implemented Color Histograms, Haralick Textures, and Hu Moments. Applied Min-Max Scaling for normalization.
- Trained SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. Used 10-fold cross-validation for performance comparison.
- Improved feature-based image classification skills. Strengthened ML model evaluation & optimization. Gained hands-on experience in dataset automation & preprocessing.

### ðŸ“Œ [MusicDanceProject-AI_Project](https://github.com/sahasgundapaneni/MusicDanceProject-AI_Project.git)
- Integrated Shazam API for song identification. Extracted title, artist, and genre from audio files.
- Developed frame-by-frame animation synchronized with music. Used Pygame mixer for real-time audio playback.
- Managed package installations using pip, pip3, and f2py. Ensured compatibility across Python 3.x versions.
- Configured pytest for automated testing. Utilized f2py for integrating high-performance computations.
- Strengthened audio processing, real-time animation, and testing automation. Improved package management & environment setup. Gained hands-on experience in event-driven programming & optimization.
